This repository contains Terraform configurations for creating a highly available and scalable Amazon EKS cluster.          
It leverages AWS best practices for security and efficiency --> we've ensured that our workloads are managed effectively. The Terraform state is stored remotely in an S3 bucket to facilitate team collaboration and to secure the state file.
